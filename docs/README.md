## 这篇文档的受众？

此文档是为对**最大化深度学习模型性能**感兴趣的工程师和（个人与团队）研究者提供的。我们假定您已拥有基础的机器学习和深度学习概念的相关认识。本文档的重点在于**超参数调整的过程**。文档同样涉及到深度学习训练的另一方面进行了探索，比如训练的方法部署和优化，但是这部分的内容并非我们完善的重点。我们假定机器学习问题是一个监督学习问题或一个与之类似的问题（例如自监督问题），这意味着本文档内的一些方法可能同样适用于其他类型的问题中。

## 为何是一本playbook？

目前，已有大量的工作和猜想的实践使深度神经网络在实践中良好地工作。然而，使用深度学习获得良好结果的实现方法很少被记录下来。论文为了更好地组织结构忽略了训练过程的描述而直接展现最终结果，与此同时聚焦于商业项目上的机器学习工程师很少有时间记录下他们的过程。教科书倾向于回避实践指导，而是优先考虑基础知识原则，即便这些作者有良好的应用经验并可以提供给有用的建议。在准备这篇文档时，我们无法找到一种能去全面解释 *如何在深度学习中获得良好结果* 的方法。相反，我们发现在博客帖子与社交媒体上找到了一些建议，包括在论文附录中的训练技巧、某个研究项目的特定训练流程以及诸多的困惑。深度学习专家和缺乏能力的实践者使用看似相同的方法在结构上也存在着鸿沟；同时，这些专家也承认他们所使用的一些技巧可能并不是有所依据的。随着深度学习的成熟并将对世界产生更大的影响，我们的社区需要更多涵盖所有对获得良好结果至关重要的实用细节和有效方法的资源。

我们是一个耕耘深度学习领域多年的五人研究者与工程师的团队，我们中的一些人早在2006年就开始了相关的研究。从语音识别到天文学，我们将深度学习应用于各种问题，并在这个过程中积累了许多知识与经验。这篇文档源于我们自己训练神经网络的经验，旨在指导机器学习的新工程师并为我们的同时提供深度学习的实践建议。尽管看到在大量的高校实验室里实践机器学习的方法和机器学习驱动的技术产品造福上亿人非常欣慰，深度学习作为一门工程学科依然处于起步阶段。我们希望这份文档可以鼓励并帮助他人理解该领域的实验方法。

这份文档是在我们试图凝练自己在深度学习的方法时产生的，因此它代表了作者当时的观点，而不是任何形式的客观事实。我们自己与超参数的调优斗争使它成为我们指南的一个特别重点，但此文档也涵盖其他我们在工作中遇到（或看到出错）的重要问题。我们的意图是让这项工作成为一份灵活的文档，并随着我们的观点会改变。例如，两年前我们如果要写关于调试和调优的材料来说是不可能的，因为它需要基于最近的研究结果和正在进行的调查。不可避免地，我们的一些建议将需要更新，以说明新的结果和改进工作流程。我们不知道*最佳的*深度学习方法，但是只要社区没开始记录并讨论不同的流程，我们就不能找到它。为此，我们鼓励那些使用我们的提出的建议并发现了更好的方法的读者，带着令人信服的证据，一起更新这篇文档。我们也希望看到其他的指南和提供可能不同建议的文档，这样我们就一起将实践做到最好。最后，任何标有🤖表情符号是我们想做更多的研究的方向。只有在我们尝试写下这篇文档之后才发现，在深度学习从业者的工作流程中可以找到多少有趣的和被忽视的研究问题。

## 开始新项目的指南

调优过程的许多决定都可以在项目开始之际决定，仅需在场景变化时偶尔需要重新考虑。

我们下文的内容有如下的假设：

-   问题的建模足够本质，数据清洗之类的工作已经完成，并且已经在模型架构和训练配置上花费实践验证有效；
-   已经建立了包含训练和评估的流程，并且对不同的研究模型容易执行训练和预测的工作；
-   选择并部署了恰当的测量手段，其中测量手段应该能充分反映部署环境下的需测量的信息。

### 选择模型架构

***总结：*** *当开始一个新项目时，尝试重新使用一个已经有效的模型。*

-   先选择一个常见的模型架构、建立好的模型。自定义的模型通常都可以在之后构建。
-   模型架构通常有许多超参数决定了模型的大小和其他细节（比如说层数、层宽、激活函数等）
    -   因此，选择模型架构意味着选择不同模型系列（通过超参数设定产生的同类型模型）。
    -   我们会在[Choosing the initial configuration](#choosing-the-initial-configuration)和[A scientific approach to improving model performance](#a-scientific-approach-to-improving-model-performance)两个模块讨论模型超参数的选择问题。
-   如果可以的话，找到和你需要解决问题相似的论文并将论文中的模型作为一个调试的出发点。

### 选择优化器

***总结:*** *就当前问题选择最欢迎的优化器。*

-   在不同机器学习问题和模型架构的背景下没有最“优”的优化器。即便是对比优化器的性能就是一个复杂的问题，详见论文[comparing the performance of optimizers is a difficult task](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05446)。🤖
-   我们建议使用构建良好的受欢迎的优化器，尤其是项目开始之时。
    -   理想情况下，对同类型问题选择最受欢迎的优化器。
-   注意所选优化器涉及的**所有**超参数：
    -   有更多超参数的优化器需要更多的调试以得到最好的配置。
    -   项目的初始阶段将优化器的超参数作为 [待调优参数](#identifying-scientific-nuisance-and-fixed-hyperparameters)并将其他超参数（比如说模型架构的超参数）的值调优非常关键。
    -   在训练开始之时选择简单的优化器（比如说固定动量的随机梯度下降或者固定$\epsilon$, $\beta_{1}$以及$\beta_{2}$的 Adam 优化器）并在之后使用更通用的优化器。
-   我们喜欢使用的一些构造良好的优化器（包括但不限于）有：
    -   [带动量的 SGD ](#what-are-the-update-rules-for-all-the-popular-optimization-algorithms)（我们喜欢使用Nesterov的变种）
    -   [Adam 和 NAdam](#what-are-the-update-rules-for-all-the-popular-optimization-algorithms)，比带动量的 SGD 更具适用性。 注意： Adam 有4个可调参数并且[他们都很有用](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05446)！
        -   参考：
            [How should Adam's hyperparameters be tuned?](#how-should-adams-hyperparameters-be-tuned)

### 选择批次大小

***总结：*** *批次大小决定了训练的速度并且不应该在为了提高验证集性能而直接更改。通常来说理想的批次大小将会是可行硬件支持的最大批次大小。*

-   批次大小是一个对 *训练时间* 长短和 *计算资源消耗* 的关键决定因素。
-   增加批次大小通常会减少训练时间。这对训练而言很有用，比如说：
    -   允许超参数更彻底地在一个固定时间间隔内调整，并能隐式地训练出更好的模型。
    -   减少开发过程的延迟，新的想法可以更快地得到测试验证。
-   增加批次大小导致的资源消耗可能会或减少、或增加或甚至不变。
-   批次大小 *不应该* 被当作验证集性能上的一个可调的超参数。
    -   只要超参数被调整好（尤其是学习率和正则参数）并且训练的步骤是合理的，使用任意不同的批次大小应该会获得相同的效果（见[Shallue 等人的论文](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03600)）。
    -   请参考 [Why shouldn't the batch size be tuned to directly improve validation set performance?](#why-shouldnt-the-batch-size-be-tuned-to-directly-improve-validation-set-performance)这一节内容。

#### 确定可行的批次大小并估量训练的吞吐

<details><summary><em>[点击展开]</em></summary>
<br>



-   对于给定的模型和优化器，通常由很多的硬件支持的批次大小选择。批次大小的限制因素主要是加速器的内存。（译注：一般指GPU的显存）
-   不幸的是，不运行代码或者至少编译整个训练程序，都无法计算合适的批次大小。
-   最简单的方法就是通常在运行训练任务时设定不同的批次大小（比如按2的幂次方选取）并在小范围内运行指导其中一项任务达到了可行的加速器内存上限。
-   对于每一个批次大小，我们应该训练足够长的时间以获得准确的 *训练吞吐* （training throughput）的估计：

<p align="center"><em>训练吞吐</em> = 每秒处理的样本数</p>

<p align="center">或者等价地计算 <em>每步消耗的时间（time per step）</em>：</p>

<p align="center"><em>每步消耗的时间</em> = (批次大小) / (训练吞吐)</p>

-   当加速器还未满载时，如果批次大小加倍那么训练的吞吐量应该也是（或者至少接近）翻倍的。等价的，每步执行的时间随着批次大小增加，应该增加（或者至少接近）一个常数。
-   如果不符合上述描述情况，那么训练的流程存在某种瓶颈，比如说系统的I/O问题或者不同计算节点的同步问题，这需要在真正训练之前诊断并纠正回来。
-   如果训练吞吐的增加和某些最大的批次大小相关，那么我们应该只考虑最大批次大小相关的批次大小选项，即便我们的硬件支持更大的批次大小。
    -   所有使用更大的批次大小带来的好处都是假定在训练吞吐增加的基础上的。如果训练吞吐增加并不会带来更好的效果，那么应该去修复瓶颈或者使用更小的批次大小。
    -   **梯度积累** 模拟了一个比硬件可支持的更大的批次大小，因此它并不能提供任何吞吐上的增益。它在应用过程中应该避免被使用。
-   这些步骤需要在模型或者优化器产生变化时进行重复（比如说一个不同的模型架构可以允许内存容纳更大的批次大小）。

</details>

#### 选择最小化训练时间的批次大小

<details><summary><em>[点击展开]</em></summary>
<p align="center">训练时间 = (每步执行时间) x (执行步骤总数)</p>


-   我们通常对不同的可行批次大小将每步执行时间粗略认为是一个常数，这种假设是合理的因为并行计算没有额外开销，并且训练瓶颈已经被攻克(如何确定训练的瓶颈请参见[前一节内容](#determining-the-feasible-batch-sizes-and-estimating-training-throughput)）。在实践中通常至少会有一些随批次大小增加而产生的开销。
-   当批次大小增加时，达到相同性能所需要的训练总步数会下降（当批次大小改变时所有相关的超参数被重新调整的情况，参考[Shallue 等人的论文](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03600)）。
    -   比如说，批次大小翻倍可能会使训练总步数减半，这称为**完美尺度变换**。
    -   完美尺度变换有一个批次大小的阈值，超出这个阈值 将不会有训练步数的增益。
    -   最后，无限地增加批次大小不会减少训练的总步数（但至少不会增加）。
-   因此最小化训练时间的批次大小通常就是能使得训练步数递减最多的最大批次大小。
    -   这个批次大小取决于数据集、模型和优化器，并且如何计算这个批次大小是一个开放的问题而不是在面对新问题时通过实验得到的。🤖
    -   当比较批次大小时，要注意样本/[回合](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#epoch)开销和单步执行开销的区别。前者是在固定数量的训练样本上进行的所有实验，后者是在训练步数固定时运行进行的所有实验。
        -   即便有更大的批次大小能提供减少训练步骤的所需要的时间的方法，对比批次大小的回合开销也只和完美尺度缩放有关。
    -   通常来说，最大的硬件支持的批次大小会比上文提到的阈值要小。因此一个绝好的方法（不需要额外的实验来验证）就是用尽可能大的批次大小。
-   某些更大的批次大小却导致训练总时间增加，这种情况一定要避免使用。

</details>

#### 选择最小化资源开销的批次大小

<details><summary><em>[点击展开]</em></summary>



-   和批次大小增加有关的资源开销有两种：
    1.  先期开销，比如使用新的硬件或在多GPU/多TPU上训练以覆写训练流程。
    2.  后期开销，比如团队资源分配、云服务器、电力/维护开销。
-   如果先期开销会随着批次大小的增加而增加，那么最好在项目成熟前拖延批次大小的增加，这更易于在成本-收益之间获得权衡。部署多主机的并行训练程序可能会引入[bugs](#considerations-for-multi-host-pipelines) 或一些微小的[issues](#batch-normalization-implementation-details) 并且最好一开始时使用简单的训练流程。（从另一方面来讲，训练时间的加速可能在早期非常有用因为此时需要大量的调参实验。）
-   我们将后期开销 （包含多种开销）称为资源消耗。 资源消耗的计算可以依据下式进行：

<p align="center">资源消耗 = (每步资源消耗) x (总执行步数)</p>

-   增加批次大小通常会 [减少训练步骤总数](#choosing-the-batch-size-to-minimize-training-time)。不管资源消耗是增加还是减少，都取决于每一步的资源消耗的变化。
    -   Increasing the batch size might *decrease* the resource consumption. For
        example, if each step with the larger batch size can be run on the same
        hardware as the smaller batch size (with only a small increase in time
        per step), then any increase in the resource consumption per step might
        be outweighed by the decrease in the number of steps.
    -   增加批次大小并 *不能改变* 资源消耗。比如说，如果将批次大小加倍会将训练的步骤数减半并增加了GPU的使用数量，GPU使用时间的总消耗并不会改变。
    -   增加批次大小可能会 *增加* 资源消耗，比如说，如果增加批次大小需要以升级硬件设施作为代价，那么每步资源消耗的增加可能会超过总的训练步数。

</details>

#### 改变批次大小需要重新调整大部分的超参数

<details><summary><em>[点击展开]</em></summary>



<br>


-   大多数的超参数的最优质对批次大小都很敏感。因此，改变批次大小可能需要重新开始调参过程。
-   与批次大小最为相关的超参数，即需要重点对不同批次大小进行调整的超参数，就是和优化其相关的超参数（比如说学习率，动量等）以及正则化参数。
-   一定要记住在项目开始之时当选择批次大小时，如果需要在后期调整批次大小使用新的批次大小，这可能会造成额外的时间消耗和重新调参的资源消耗。

</details>

#### 批次归一化如何与批次大小相关

<details><summary><em>[点击展开]</em></summary>



<br>


-   批次归一化很复杂，并且通常时使用不同的批次大小而不是梯度计算去计算统计量（compute statistics）。详情请参考[batch norm section](#batch-normalization-implementation-details) 部分的内容。

</details>

### 选择初始配置

-   在开始调整潮参数之前必须先确定出发点。包括(1)模型的配置（比如说模型的层数），(2)优化器的参数（比如说学习率），(3)训练步数。
-   确定初始配置需要人工参与到训练配置和试错过程。
-   我们的指导目的是帮助找到一种简单、相对快速、较少资源消耗并能得到一个合理的结果的的配置方法。
    -   “简单”意味着避免任何额外的功能的使用，因为这些可以在后期添加上。即便额外的功能能有效帮助提升模型效果，在训练初期使用它们其实有浪费时间调参或引入不必要的计算复杂度的风险和问题。
        -   比如说，使用一个固定的学习率衰减常数进行训练，而不是使用各种花里胡哨的学习率迭代方法更改学习率。
    -   选择快速且资源消耗少的初始配置，这能帮助调参更加高效进行。
        -   比如说，使用一个更小的模型开始训练。
    -   合理的”性能表现取决于问题，但至少要保证训练好的模型在验证集上的表型要比随机选择的结果好（尽管效果很差并不值得部署）。
-   训练的步数选择需要考虑如下因素的平衡：
    -   从另一个角度说，更多步骤的训练能提高性能并且能使超参数调整更简单 (见 [Shallue 等人的论文](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03600))。
    -   另一方面，更少步骤的训练意味着更少的资源消耗和更快的训练速度，通过减少训练间隔时间加速调参性能并允许并行地进行实验。而且如果在初始选择了不必要的大额开销（step budget），那么很难在训练过程中更改，比如说一开始选择了和训练步骤相关的学习率迭代方法。

## 一种提高模型性能的科学方法

机器学习的发展的终极目标就是最大化发挥部署模型的功能。即便和其他应用的开发（比如说开发时间、可行的计算资源、模型类型）有很多区别，我们同样可以针对问题使用一些相同基础的方法以及规则。

我们的指南依照如下假设进行：

-   已经存在一个完全可行的训练方法和可获得合理结果的配置。
-   有足够的计算资源以完成调参实验并且能并行地运行多个训练任务。

### 增量调参策略

***总结:*** *开始时使用一个简单的配置并在针对问题逐渐增加额外的提升因素。确保任何的提升都有可靠的证据支撑，并且避免引入不必要的复杂度。*

-   我们的最终目的是找到一个能最大化发挥模型性能的配置。
    -   在某些情况下，我们的目标是在期限时间内最大化模型性能。
    -   在另一些情况下，我们希望模型能够持续地不断提升性能（比如说不断地在使用过程中提升性能）。
-   原则上来说，我们可以使用一种算法来自动搜索整个可行的配置空间中的配置，但是这不是一个实践中会考虑的方法。
    -   可行的配置空间非常大并且暂时还没有一种算法能够在没有人类干预情况下精确地高效搜索到这个配置。
-   大多数的自动搜索算法依赖人类设计的 *搜索空间* ，这个人为规定的配置空间对决定搜索算法搜索结果的性能有重要影响。
-   最有效的最大化模型性能方法就是使用一个简单的配置开始训练，并在训练过程中逐渐增加功能和提升方法。
    -   我们使用自动搜索方法在每一轮调参并不断更新搜索空间，并把更新结果作为我们的理解增长的表现。
-   随着我们的探索我们很自然地找到越来越好的配置，然后我们最“好”的模型性能也不断地提高。
    -   我们称我们更新时得到的最好配置为一个 *发行(launch)* ，这个最好的配置可能或也可能不是生产过程中的实际的发行。
    -   For each launch, we must make sure that the change is based on strong
        evidence – not just random chance based on a lucky configuration – so
        that we don't add unnecessary complexity to the training pipeline.对于每一个发行，我们必须确保每一个改变都有可靠的证据支撑-不是运气好捧出来的一个随机配置-因此我们不会在训练流程中添加额外的不必要的复杂度。

从高级的角度来讲，我们的增量调参策略就是如下四个步骤的重复：

1.  确定下一轮实验的目标的合适范围。
2.  设计并且运行一系列的实验使得模型朝目标方向移动。
3.  从实验结果中分析原因。
4.  考虑是否发行最好的配置。

本节的后续内容将更详细地描述这种策略。

### 探索 vs 验证

***总结:*** *大多数时候我们的主要目标是深入地了解一个问题。*

-   尽管有人会认为我们使用了太多时间来最大化验证集上的性能，但我们在实践中我们尝试花更多的时间深入了解问题，并相对花费较少的精力解决验证集错误的问题。
    -   从另一方面来讲，我们大多数的时间使用在“探索”，而“验证”只占了很少一部分。
-   长期来看，如果要最大化模型最终i性能，理解问题更重要。短期内对问题的深入了解有助于我们：
    -   避免性能良好的过程中仅通过训练过程中偶尔的意外引入不必要的改变。
    -   确定验证集错误中对超参数最敏感的因素，哪些超参数需要以及和其他超参数一起被重新调整，哪些超参数不那么敏感可以在后面的实验中设定为常量。
    -   尝试一些可能有效的功能，比如说如果出现了过拟合尝试使用新的正则化方法。
    -   确认对结果影响无关的特征并将其移除，为后来的实验减少复杂度。
    -   辨识出超参数调整对模型性能提升的饱和情况。
    -   缩小搜索空间到最优值附近以提高调参效率。
-   当我们最终决定“贪婪”尝试新方法，我们可以将注意力完全放在验证集错误，即便实验还没有针对调参问题的本质得到最有用的信息。

### 选择下一轮实验的目标

***总结:*** *每一轮实验都应该有一个清晰的目标并且可以通过实验逼近这个目标并有效缩小问题的规模。*

-   每一轮实验都应该有一个清晰的目标并且可以通过实验逼近这个目标并有效缩小问题的规模：如果我们尝试同时增加更多的特征或回答更多的问题，我们可能不能分辨出究竟是哪一个在发挥作用。
-   目标的案例包括：
    -   尝试在训练流程使用通用的提升方法（比如说新的正则项，预处理选项等等）
    -   理解某一个模型的超参数的影响（比如说激活函数）
    -   贪婪地最大化验证集误差。

### 设计下一轮实验

***总结:*** *确定哪些超参数是研究对象（scientific）、无关干扰（nuisance）以及固定常量（fuxed）。在忽略无关的超参时优化创建一个研究的序列来对比不同研究对象超参数取值的影响，通过给定的研究对象超参选择无关超参的搜索空间以平衡资源消耗。*

#### Identifying scientific, nuisance, and fixed hyperparameters

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>


<br>

-   For a given goal, all hyperparameters will be either **scientific
    hyperparameters**, **nuisance hyperparameters**, or **fixed
    hyperparameters**.
    -   Scientific hyperparameters are those whose effect on the model's
        performance we're trying to measure.
    -   Nuisance hyperparameters are those that need to be optimized over in
        order to fairly compare different values of the scientific
        hyperparameters. This is similar to the statistical concept of
        [nuisance parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuisance_parameter).
    -   Fixed hyperparameters will have their values fixed in the current round
        of experiments. These are hyperparameters whose values do not need to
        (or we do not want them to) change when comparing different values of
        the scientific hyperparameters.
        -   By fixing certain hyperparameters for a set of experiments, we must
            accept that conclusions derived from the experiments might not be
            valid for other settings of the fixed hyperparameters. In other
            words, fixed hyperparameters create caveats for any conclusions we
            draw from the experiments.
-   For example, if our goal is to "determine whether a model with more hidden
    layers will reduce validation error", then the number of hidden layers is a
    scientific hyperparameter.
    -   The learning rate is a nuisance hyperparameter because we can only
        fairly compare models with different numbers of hidden layers if the
        learning rate is tuned separately for each number of layers (the optimal
        learning rate generally depends on the model architecture).
    -   The activation function could be a fixed hyperparameter if we have
        determined in prior experiments that the best choice of activation
        function is not sensitive to model depth, or if we are willing to limit
        our conclusions about the number of hidden layers to only cover this
        specific choice of activation function. Alternatively, it could be a
        nuisance parameter if we are prepared to tune it separately for each
        number of hidden layers.
-   Whether a particular hyperparameter is a scientific hyperparameter, nuisance
    hyperparameter, or fixed hyperparameter is not inherent to that
    hyperparameter, but changes depending on the experimental goal.
    -   For example, the choice of activation function could be a scientific
        hyperparameter (is ReLU or tanh a better choice for our problem?), a
        nuisance hyperparameter (is the best 5-layer model better than the best
        6-layer model when we allow several different possible activation
        functions?), or a fixed hyperparameter (for ReLU nets, does adding batch
        normalization in a particular position help?).
-   When designing a new round of experiments, we first identify the scientific
    hyperparameters for our experimental goal.
    -   At this stage, we consider all other hyperparameters to be nuisance
        hyperparameters.
-   Next, we convert some of the nuisance hyperparameters into fixed
    hyperparameters.
    -   With limitless resources, we would leave all non-scientific
        hyperparameters as nuisance hyperparameters so that the conclusions we
        draw from our experiments are free from caveats about fixed
        hyperparameter values.
    -   However, the more nuisance hyperparameters we attempt to tune, the
        greater the risk we fail to tune them sufficiently well for each setting
        of the scientific hyperparameters and end up reaching the wrong
        conclusions from our experiments.
        -   As described
            [below](#striking-a-balance-between-informative-and-affordable-experiments),
            we could counter this risk by increasing the computational budget,
            but often our maximum resource budget is less than would be needed
            to tune over all non-scientific hyperparameters.
    -   We choose to convert a nuisance hyperparameter into a fixed
        hyperparameter when, in our judgment, the caveats introduced by fixing
        it are less burdensome than the cost of including it as a nuisance
        hyperparameter.
        -   The more a given nuisance hyperparameter interacts with the
            scientific hyperparameters, the more damaging it is to fix its
            value. For example, the best value of the weight decay strength
            typically depends on the model size, so comparing different model
            sizes assuming a single specific value of the weight decay would not
            be very insightful.
-   Although the type we assign to each hyperparameter depends on the
    experimental goal, we have the following rules of thumb for certain
    categories of hyperparameters:
    -   Of the various optimizer hyperparameters (e.g. the learning rate,
        momentum, learning rate schedule parameters, Adam betas etc.), at least
        some of them will be nuisance hyperparameters because they tend to
        interact the most with other changes.
        -   They are rarely scientific hyperparameters because a goal like "what
            is the best learning rate for the current pipeline?" doesn't give
            much insight – the best setting could easily change with the next
            pipeline change anyway.
        -   Although we might fix some of them occasionally due to resource
            constraints or when we have particularly strong evidence that they
            don't interact with the scientific parameters, we should generally
            assume that optimizer hyperparameters must be tuned separately to
            make fair comparisons between different settings of the scientific
            hyperparameters, and thus shouldn't be fixed.
            -   Furthermore, we have no *a priori* reason to prefer one
                optimizer hyperparameter value over another (e.g. they don't
                usually affect the computational cost of forward passes or
                gradients in any way).
    -   In contrast, the *choice* of optimizer is typically a scientific
        hyperparameter or fixed hyperparameter.
        -   It is a scientific hyperparameter if our experimental goal involves
            making fair comparisons between two or more different optimizers
            (e.g. "determine which optimizer produces the lowest validation
            error in a given number of steps").
        -   Alternatively, we might make it a fixed hyperparameter for a variety
            of reasons, including (1) prior experiments make us believe that the
            best optimizer for our problem is not sensitive to current
            scientific hyperparameters; and/or (2) we prefer to compare values
            of the scientific hyperparameters using this optimizer because its
            training curves are easier to reason about; and/or (3) we prefer to
            use this optimizer because it uses less memory than the
            alternatives.
    -   Hyperparameters introduced by a regularization technique are typically
        nuisance hyperparameters, but whether or not we include the
        regularization technique at all is a scientific or fixed hyperparameter.
        -   For example, dropout adds code complexity, so when deciding whether
            to include it we would make "no dropout" vs "dropout" a scientific
            hyperparameter and the dropout rate a nuisance hyperparameter.
            -   If we decide to add dropout to our pipeline based on this
                experiment, then the dropout rate would be a nuisance
                hyperparameter in future experiments.
    -   Architectural hyperparameters are often scientific or fixed
        hyperparameters because architecture changes can affect serving and
        training costs, latency, and memory requirements.
        -   For example, the number of layers is typically a scientific or fixed
            hyperparameter since it tends to have dramatic consequences for
            training speed and memory usage.
-   In some cases, the sets of nuisance and fixed hyperparameters will depend on
    the values of the scientific hyperparameters.
    -   For example, suppose we are trying to determine which optimizer out of
        Nesterov momentum and Adam results in the lowest validation error. The
        scientific hyperparameter is the `optimizer`, which takes values
        `{"Nesterov_momentum", "Adam"}`. The value
        `optimizer="Nesterov_momentum"` introduces the nuisance/fixed
        hyperparameters `{learning_rate, momentum}`, but the value
        `optimizer="Adam"` introduces the nuisance/fixed hyperparameters
        `{learning_rate, beta1, beta2, epsilon}`.
    -   Hyperparameters that are only present for certain values of the
        scientific hyperparameters are called **conditional hyperparameters**.
    -   We should not assume two conditional hyperparameters are the same just
        because they have the same name! In the above example, the conditional
        hyperparameter called `learning_rate` is a *different* hyperparameter
        for `optimizer="Nesterov_momentum"` versus `optimizer="Adam"`. Its role
        is similar (although not identical) in the two algorithms, but the range
        of values that work well in each of the optimizers is typically
        different by several orders of magnitude.

#### Creating a set of studies

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>


<br>


-   Once we have identified the scientific and nuisance hyperparameters, we
    design a "study" or sequence of studies to make progress towards the
    experimental goal.
    -   A study specifies a set of hyperparameter configurations to be run for
        subsequent analysis. Each configuration is called a "trial".
    -   Creating a study typically involves choosing the hyperparameters that
        will vary across trials, choosing what values those hyperparameters can
        take on (the "search space"), choosing the number of trials, and
        choosing an automated search algorithm to sample that many trials from
        the search space. Alternatively, we could create a study by specifying
        the set of hyperparameter configurations manually.
-   The purpose of the studies is to run the pipeline with different values of
    the scientific hyperparameters, while at the same time **"optimizing away"**
    (or "optimizing over") the nuisance hyperparameters so that comparisons
    between different values of the scientific hyperparameters are as fair as
    possible.
-   In the simplest case, we would make a separate study for each configuration
    of the scientific parameters, where each study tunes over the nuisance
    hyperparameters.
    -   For example, if our goal is to select the best optimizer out of Nesterov
        momentum and Adam, we could create one study in which
        `optimizer="Nesterov_momentum"` and the nuisance hyperparameters are
        `{learning_rate, momentum}`, and another study in which
        `optimizer="Adam"` and the nuisance hyperparameters are `{learning_rate,
        beta1, beta2, epsilon}`. We would compare the two optimizers by
        selecting the best performing trial from each study.
    -   We can use any gradient-free optimization algorithm, including methods
        such as Bayesian optimization or evolutionary algorithms, to optimize
        over the nuisance hyperparameters, although
        [we prefer](#why-use-quasi-random-search-instead-of-more-sophisticated-black-box-optimization-algorithms-during-the-exploration-phase-of-tuning)
        to use quasi-random search in the
        [exploration phase](#exploration-vs-exploitation) of tuning because of a
        variety of advantages it has in this setting.
        [After exploration concludes](#after-exploration-concludes), if
        state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization software is available, that is
        our preferred choice.
-   In the more complicated case where we want to compare a large number of
    values of the scientific hyperparameters and it is impractical to make that
    many independent studies, we can include the scientific parameters in the
    same search space as the nuisance hyperparameters and use a search algorithm
    to sample values of *both* the scientific and nuisance hyperparameters in a
    single study.
    -   When taking this approach, conditional hyperparameters can cause
        problems since it is hard to specify a search space unless the set of
        nuisance hyperparameters is the same for all values of the scientific
        hyperparameters.
    -   In this case,
        [our preference](#why-use-quasi-random-search-instead-of-more-sophisticated-black-box-optimization-algorithms-during-the-exploration-phase-of-tuning)
        for using quasi-random search over fancier black-box optimization tools
        is even stronger, since it ensures that we obtain a relatively uniform
        sampling of values of the scientific hyperparameters. Regardless of the
        search algorithm, we need to make sure somehow that it searches the
        scientific parameters uniformly.

#### Striking a balance between informative and affordable experiments

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>


<br>


-   When designing a study or sequence of studies, we need to allocate a limited
    budget in order to adequately achieve the following three desiderata:
    1.  Comparing enough different values of the scientific hyperparameters.
    2.  Tuning the nuisance hyperparameters over a large enough search space.
    3.  Sampling the search space of nuisance hyperparameters densely enough.
-   The better we can achieve these three desiderata, the more insight we can
    extract from our experiment.
    -   Comparing as many values of the scientific hyperparameters as possible
        broadens the scope of the insights we gain from the experiment.
    -   Including as many nuisance hyperparameters as possible and allowing each
        nuisance hyperparameter to vary over as wide a range as possible
        increases our confidence that a "good" value of the nuisance
        hyperparameters **exists** in the search space for each configuration of
        the scientific hyperparameters.
        -   Otherwise, we might make unfair comparisons between values of the
            scientific hyperparameters by not searching possible regions of the
            nuisance parameter space where better values might lie for some
            values of the scientific parameters.
    -   Sampling the search space of nuisance hyperparameters as densely as
        possible increases our confidence that any good settings for the
        nuisance hyperparameters that happen to exist in our search space will
        be found by the search procedure.
        -   Otherwise, we might make unfair comparisons between values of the
            scientific parameters due to some values getting luckier with the
            sampling of the nuisance hyperparameters.
-   Unfortunately, improvements in *any* of these three dimensions require
    either increasing the number of trials, and therefore increasing the
    resource cost, or finding a way to save resources in one of the other
    dimensions.
    -   Every problem has its own idiosyncrasies and computational constraints,
        so how to allocate resources across these three desiderata requires some
        level of domain knowledge.
    -   After running a study, we always try to get a sense of whether the study
        tuned the nuisance hyperparameters well enough (i.e. searched a large
        enough space extensively enough) to fairly compare the scientific
        hyperparameters (as described in greater detail
        [below](#extracting-insight-from-experimental-results)).

</details>

### Extracting insight from experimental results

***Summary:*** *In addition to trying to achieve the original scientific goal of
each group of experiments, go through a checklist of additional questions and,
if issues are discovered, revise the experiments and rerun them.*

-   Ultimately, each group of experiments has a specific goal and we want to
    evaluate the evidence the experiments provide toward that goal.
    -   However, if we ask the right questions, we will often find issues that
        need to be corrected before a given set of experiments can make much
        progress towards their original goal.
        -   If we don’t ask these questions, we may draw incorrect conclusions.
    -   Since running experiments can be expensive, we also want to take the
        opportunity to extract other useful insights from each group of
        experiments, even if these insights are not immediately relevant to the
        current goal.
-   Before analyzing a given set of experiments to make progress toward their
    original goal, we should ask ourselves the following additional questions:
    -   [Is the search space large enough?](#identifying-bad-search-space-boundaries)
        -   If the optimal point from a study is near the boundary of the search
            space in one or more dimensions, the search is probably not wide
            enough. In this case, we should run another study with an expanded
            search space.
    -   [Have we sampled enough points from the search space?](#not-sampling-enough-points-in-the-search-space)
        -   If not, run more points or be less ambitious in the tuning goals.
    -   What fraction of the trials in each study are **infeasible** (i.e.
        trials that diverge, get really bad loss values, or fail to run at all
        because they violate some implicit constraint)?
        -   When a very large fraction of points in a study are **infeasible**
            we should try to adjust the search space to avoid sampling such
            points, which sometimes requires reparameterizing the search space.
        -   In some cases, a large number of infeasible points can indicate a
            bug in the training code.
    -   [Does the model exhibit optimization issues?](#how-can-optimization-failures-be-debugged-and-mitigated)
    -   [What can we learn from the training curves of the best trials?](#examining-the-training-curves)
        -   For example, do the best trials have training curves consistent with
            problematic overfitting?
-   If necessary, based on the answers to the questions above, refine the most
    recent study (or group of studies) to improve the search space and/or sample
    more trials, or take some other corrective action.
-   Once we have answered the above questions, we can move on to evaluating the
    evidence the experiments provide towards our original goal (for example,
    [evaluating whether a change is useful](#detecting-whether-a-change-is-useful-with-isolation-plots)).

#### Identifying bad search space boundaries

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>


<br>


-   A search space is suspicious if the best point sampled from it is close to
    its boundary. We might find an even better point if we expanded the search
    range in that direction.
-   To check search space boundaries, we like to plot completed trials on what
    we call **basic hyperparameter axis plots** where we plot the validation
    objective value versus one of the hyperparameters (e.g. learning rate). Each
    point on the plot corresponds to a single trial.
    -   The validation objective value for each trial should usually be the best
        value it achieved over the course of training.

<p align="center" id="figure-1">
<img src="assets/bad_search_space.png" width="49%" alt="Example of bad search space boundaries">
<img src="assets/good_search_space.png" width="49%" alt="Example of good search space boundaries">
</p>


<p align="center"><b>Figure 1:</b> Examples of bad search space boundaries and acceptable search space boundaries.</p>

-   The plots in [Figure 1](#figure-1) show the error rate (lower is better)
    against the initial learning rate.
-   If the best points cluster towards the edge of a search space (in some
    dimension), then the search space boundaries might need to be expanded until
    the best observed point is no longer close to the boundary.
-   Often, a study will include "infeasible" trials that diverge or get very bad
    results (marked with red Xs in the above plots).
    -   If all trials are infeasible for learning rates greater than some
        threshold value, and if the best performing trials have learning rates
        at the edge of that region, the model [may suffer from stability issues
        preventing it from accessing higher learning
        rates](#how-can-optimization-failures-be-debugged-and-mitigated).

</details>

#### Not sampling enough points in the search space

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>


<br>


-   In general,
    [it can be very difficult to know](#how-many-trials-are-needed-to-get-good-results-with-quasi-random-search)
    if the search space has been sampled densely enough. 🤖
-   Running more trials is of course better, but comes at an obvious cost.
-   Since it is so hard to know when we have sampled enough, we usually sample
    what we can afford and try to calibrate our intuitive confidence from
    repeatedly looking at various hyperparameter axis plots and trying to get a
    sense of how many points are in the "good" region of the search space.

</details>

#### Examining the training curves

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>


<br>


***Summary:*** *Examining the training curves is an easy way to identify common
failure modes and can help us prioritize what actions to take next.*

-   Although in many cases the primary objective of our experiments only
    requires considering the validation error of each trial, we must be careful
    when reducing each trial to a single number because it can hide important
    details about what’s going on below the surface.
-   For every study, we always look at the **training curves** (training error
    and validation error plotted versus training step over the duration of
    training) of at least the best few trials.
-   Even if this is not necessary for addressing the primary experimental
    objective, examining the training curves is an easy way to identify common
    failure modes and can help us prioritize what actions to take next.
-   When examining the training curves, we are interested in the following
    questions.
-   Are any of the trials exhibiting **problematic overfitting?**
    -   Problematic overfitting occurs when the validation error starts
        *increasing* at some point during training.
    -   In experimental settings where we optimize away nuisance hyperparameters
        by selecting the "best" trial for each setting of the scientific
        hyperparameters, we should check for problematic overfitting in *at
        least* each of the best trials corresponding to the settings of the
        scientific hyperparameters that we’re comparing.
        -   If any of the best trials exhibits problematic overfitting, we
            usually want to re-run the experiment with additional regularization
            techniques and/or better tune the existing regularization parameters
            before comparing the values of the scientific hyperparameters.
            -   This may not apply if the scientific hyperparameters include
                regularization parameters, since then it would not be surprising
                if low-strength settings of those regularization parameters
                resulted in problematic overfitting.
        -   Reducing overfitting is often straightforward using common
            regularization techniques that add minimal code complexity or extra
            computation (e.g. dropout, label smoothing, weight decay), so it’s
            usually no big deal to add one or more of these to the next round of
            experiments.
        -   For example, if the scientific hyperparameter is "number of hidden
            layers" and the best trial that uses the largest number of hidden
            layers exhibited problematic overfitting, then we would usually
            prefer to try it again with additional regularization instead of
            immediately selecting the smaller number of hidden layers.
        -   Even if none of the "best" trials are exhibiting problematic
            overfitting, there might still be a problem if it occurs in *any* of
            the trials.
            -   Selecting the best trial suppresses configurations exhibiting
                problematic overfitting and favors those that do not. In other
                words, it will favor configurations with more regularization.
            -   However, anything that makes training worse can act as a
                regularizer, even if it wasn't intended that way. For example,
                choosing a smaller learning rate can regularize training by
                hobbling the optimization process, but we typically don't want
                to choose the learning rate this way.
            -   So we must be aware that the "best" trial for each setting of
                the scientific hyperparameters might be selected in such a way
                that favors "bad" values of some of the scientific or nuisance
                hyperparameters.
-   Is there high step-to-step variance in the training or validation error late
    in training?
    -   If so, this could interfere with our ability to compare different values
        of the scientific hyperparameters (since each trial randomly ends on a
        "lucky" or "unlucky" step) and our ability to reproduce the result of
        the best trial in production (since the production model might not end
        on the same "lucky" step as in the study).
    -   The most likely causes of step-to-step variance are batch variance (from
        randomly sampling examples from the training set for each batch), small
        validation sets, and using a learning rate that’s too high late in
        training.
    -   Possible remedies include increasing the batch size, obtaining more
        validation data, using learning rate decay, or using Polyak averaging.
-   Are the trials still improving at the end of training?
    -   If so, this indicates that we are in the
        ["compute bound" regime](#determining-the-number-of-steps-for-each-training-run)
        and we may benefit from
        [increasing the number of training steps](#Deciding-how-long-to-train-when-training-is-compute-bound)
        or changing the learning rate schedule.
-   Has performance on the training and validation sets saturated long before
    the final training step?
    -   If so, this indicates that we are in the
        ["not compute-bound"](#determining-the-number-of-steps-for-each-training-run)
        regime and that we may be able to
        [decrease the number of training steps](#deciding-how-long-to-train-when-training-is-not-compute-bound).
-   Although we cannot enumerate them all, there are many other additional
    behaviors that can become evident from examining the training curves (e.g.
    training loss *increasing* during training usually indicates a bug in the
    training pipeline).

#### Detecting whether a change is useful with isolation plots

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>


<br>


<p align="center" id="figure-2">
<img src="assets/isolation_plot.png" width="49%" alt="Isolation plot that investigates the best value of weight decay for ResNet-50
trained on ImageNet.">
</p>


<p align="center"><b>Figure 2:</b> Isolation plot that investigates the best value of weight decay for ResNet-50 trained on ImageNet.</p>

-   Often, the goal of a set of experiments is to compare different values of a
    scientific hyperparameter.
    -   For example, we may want to determine the value of weight decay that
        results in the best validation error.
-   An **isolation plot** is a special case of the basic hyper-parameter axis
    plot. Each point on an isolation plot corresponds to the performance of the
    *best* trial across some (or all) of the nuisance hyperparameters.
    -   In other words, we plot the model performance after "optimizing away"
        the nuisance hyperparameters.
-   An isolation plot makes it easier to perform an apples-to-apples comparison
    between different values of the scientific hyperparameter.
-   For example, [Figure 2](#figure-2) reveals the value of weight decay that
    produces the best validation performance for a particular configuration of
    ResNet-50 trained on ImageNet.
    -   If our goal is to determine whether to include weight decay at all, then
        we would compare the best point from this plot against the baseline of
        no weight decay. For a fair comparison, the baseline should also have
        its learning rate equally well tuned.
-   When we have data generated by (quasi)random search and are considering a
    continuous hyperparameter for an isolation plot, we can approximate the
    isolation plot by bucketing the x-axis values of the basic hyperparameter
    axis plot and taking the best trial in each vertical slice defined by the
    buckets.

</details>

#### Automate generically useful plots

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>


<br>

-   The more effort it is to generate plots, the less likely we are to look at
    them as much as we should, so it behooves us to set up our infrastructure to
    automatically produce as many of them as possible.
-   At a minimum, we automatically generate basic hyperparameter axis plots for
    all hyperparameters that we vary in an experiment.
-   Additionally, we automatically produce training curves for all trials and
    make it as easy as possible to find the best few trials of each study and
    examine their training curves.
-   There are many other potential plots and visualizations we can add that can
    be useful. Although the ones described above are a good starting point, to
    paraphrase Geoffrey Hinton, "Every time you plot something new, you learn
    something new."

</details>

### Determining whether to adopt a training pipeline change or hyperparameter configuration

***Summary:*** *When deciding whether to make a change to our model or training
procedure or adopt a new hyperparameter configuration going forward, we need to
be aware of the different sources of variation in our results.*

-   When we are trying to improve our model, we might observe that a particular
    candidate change initially achieves a better validation error compared to
    our incumbent configuration, but find that after repeating the experiment
    there is no consistent advantage. Informally, we can group the most
    important sources of variation that might cause such an inconsistent result
    into the following broad categories:
    -   **Training procedure variance**, **retrain variance**, or **trial
        variance**: the variation we see between training runs that use the same
        hyperparameters, but different random seeds.
        -   For example, different random initializations, training data
            shuffles, dropout masks, patterns of data augmentation operations,
            and orderings of parallel arithmetic operations, are all potential
            sources of trial variance.
    -   **Hyperparameter search variance**, or **study variance**: the variation
        in results caused by our procedure to select the hyperparameters.
        -   For example, we might run the same experiment with a particular
            search space, but with two different seeds for quasi-random search
            and end up selecting different hyperparameter values.
    -   **Data collection and sampling variance**: the variance from any sort of
        random split into training, validation, and test data or variance due to
        the training data generation process more generally.
-   It is all well and good to make comparisons of validation error rates
    estimated on a finite validation set using fastidious statistical tests, but
    often the trial variance alone can produce statistically significant
    differences between two different trained models that use the same
    hyperparameter settings.
-   We are most concerned about study variance when trying to make conclusions
    that go beyond the level of an individual point in hyperparameters space.
    -   The study variance depends on the number of trials and the search space
        and we have seen cases where it is larger than the trial variance as
        well as cases where it is much smaller.
-   Therefore, before adopting a candidate change, consider running the best
    trial N times to characterize the run-to-run trial variance.
    -   Usually, we can get away with only recharacterizing the trial variance
        after major changes to the pipeline, but in some applications we might
        need fresher estimates.
    -   In other applications, characterizing the trial variance is too costly
        to be worth it.
-   At the end of the day, although we only want to adopt changes (including new
    hyperparameter configurations) that produce real improvements, demanding
    complete certainty that something helps isn't the right answer either.
-   Therefore, if a new hyperparameter point (or other change) gets a better
    result than the baseline (taking into account the retrain variance of both
    the new point and the baseline as best we can), then we probably should
    adopt it as the new baseline for future comparisons.
    -   However, we should only adopt changes that produce improvements that
        outweigh any complexity they add.

### After exploration concludes

***Summary:*** *Bayesian optimization tools are a compelling option once we’re
done exploring for good search spaces and have decided what hyperparameters even
should be tuned at all.*

-   At some point, our priorities will shift from learning more about the tuning
    problem to producing a single best configuration to launch or otherwise use.
-   At this point, there should be a refined search space that comfortably
    contains the local region around the best observed trial and has been
    adequately sampled.
-   Our exploration work should have revealed the most essential hyperparameters
    to tune (as well as sensible ranges for them) that we can use to construct a
    search space for a final automated tuning study using as large a tuning
    budget as possible.
-   Since we no longer care about maximizing our insight into the tuning
    problem, many of
    [the advantages of quasi-random search](#why-use-quasi-random-search-instead-of-more-sophisticated-black-box-optimization-algorithms-during-the-exploration-phase-of-tuning)
    no longer apply and Bayesian optimization tools should be used to
    automatically find the best hyperparameter configuration.
    -   If the search space contains a non-trivial volume of divergent points
        (points that get NaN training loss or even training loss many standard
        deviations worse than the mean), it is important to use black box
        optimization tools that properly handle trials that diverge (see
        [Bayesian Optimization with Unknown Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.5607)
        for an excellent way to deal with this issue).
-   At this point, we should also consider checking the performance on the test
    set.
    -   In principle, we could even fold the validation set into the training
        set and retraining the best configuration found with Bayesian
        optimization. However, this is only appropriate if there won't be future
        launches with this specific workload (e.g. a one-time Kaggle
        competition).

## Determining the number of steps for each training run

-   There are two types of workloads: those that are compute-bound and those
    that are not.
-   When training is **compute-bound**, training is limited by how long we are
    willing to wait and not by how much training data we have or some other
    factor.
    -   In this case, if we can somehow train longer or more efficiently, we
        should see a lower training loss and, with proper tuning, an improved
        validation loss.
    -   In other words, *speeding up* training is equivalent to *improving*
        training and the "optimal" training time is always "as long as we can
        afford."
    -   That said, just because a workload is compute-limited doesn't mean
        training longer/faster is the only way to improve results.
-   When training is **not compute-bound**, we can afford to train as long as we
    would like to, and, at some point, training longer doesn't help much (or
    even causes problematic overfitting).
    -   In this case, we should expect to be able to train to very low training
        loss, to the point where training longer might slightly reduce the
        training loss, but will not meaningfully reduce the validation loss.
    -   Particularly when training is not compute-bound, a more generous
        training time budget can make tuning easier, especially when tuning
        learning rate decay schedules, since they have a particularly strong
        interaction with the training budget.
        -   In other words, very stingy training time budgets might require a
            learning rate decay schedule tuned to perfection in order to achieve
            a good error rate.
-   Regardless of whether a given workload is compute-bound or not, methods that
    increase the variance of the gradients (across batches) will usually result
    in slower training progress, and thus may increase the number of training
    steps required to reach a particular validation loss. High gradient variance
    can be caused by:
    -   Using a smaller batch size
    -   Adding data augmentation
    -   Adding some types of regularization (e.g. dropout)

### Deciding how long to train when training is *not* compute-bound

-   Our main goal is to ensure we are training long enough for the model to
    reach the best possible result, while avoiding being overly wasteful in the
    number of training steps.
-   When in doubt, err on the side of training longer. Performance should never
    degrade when training longer, assuming retrospective (optimal) checkpoint
    selection is used properly and checkpoints are frequent enough.
-   Never tune the `max_train_steps` number in a study. Pick a value and use it
    for all trials. From these trials, plot the training step that retrospective
    checkpoint selection finds in order to refine the choice of
    `max_train_steps`.
    -   For example, if the best step is always during the first 10% of
        training, then the maximum number of steps is way too high.
    -   Alternatively, if the best step is consistently in the last 25% of
        training we might benefit from training longer and re-tuning the decay
        schedule.
-   The ideal number of training steps can change when the architecture or data
    changes (e.g. adding data augmentation).
-   Below we describe how to pick an initial candidate value for
    `max_train_steps` based on the number of steps necessary to "perfectly fit"
    the training set using a constant learning rate.
    -   Note, we are not using the phrase "perfectly fit the training set" in a
        precise or mathematically well-defined way. It is merely meant as an
        informal descriptor to indicate a very low training loss.
        -   For example, when training with the log loss, absent regularization
            terms, we might see the training loss keep slowly improving until we
            reach floating point limits as the network weights grow without
            bound and the predictions of the model on the training set become
            increasingly confident. In this case, we might say the model
            "perfectly fit" the training set around the time the
            misclassification error reached zero on the training set.
    -   The starting value for `max_train_steps` we find may need to be
        increased if the amount of gradient noise in the training procedure
        increases.
        -   For example, if data augmentation or regularizers like dropout are
            introduced to the model.
    -   It may be possible to decrease `max_train_steps` if the training process
        improves somehow.
        -   For example, with a better tuned optimizer or a better tuned
            learning rate schedule.

#### Algorithm for picking an initial candidate for max_train_steps using a learning rate sweep

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>


<br>

-   This procedure assumes it is possible to not only "perfectly" fit the
    training set, but to do so using a constant learning rate schedule.
-   If it is possible to perfectly fit the entire training set, then there must
    exist a configuration (with some value of `max_train_steps`) that perfectly
    fits the training set; find any such configuration and use its value of
    `max_train_steps` as a starting point `N`.
-   Run a constant learning rate sweep (i.e. grid search the learning rate)
    without data augmentation and without regularization where each trial trains
    for `N` steps.
-   The number of steps required for the fastest trial in the sweep to reach
    perfect training performance is our initial guess for `max_train_steps`.
-   **NOTE:** Bad search spaces can make it possible to engage in
    self-deception.
    -   For example, if all the learning rates in a study are too small, we
        might incorrectly conclude that a very large value of `max_train_steps`
        is necessary.
    -   At a minimum, we should check that the optimal learning rate in the
        study is not at the boundary of the search space.

</details>

### Deciding how long to train when training is compute-bound

-   In some cases, training loss keeps improving indefinitely and our patience
    and computational resources become the limiting factors.
-   If training loss (or even validation loss) keeps improving indefinitely,
    should we always train as long as we can afford? Not necessarily.
    -   We might be able to tune more effectively by running a larger number of
        shorter experiments and reserving the longest "production length" runs
        for the models we hope to launch.
    -   As the training time for trials approaches our patience limit, tuning
        experiments become more relevant for our potential launch candidates,
        but we can complete fewer of them.
    -   There are probably many questions we can answer while only training for
        ~10% of the production length, but there is always a risk that our
        conclusions at this time limit will not apply to experiments at 20% of
        the production length, let alone 100%.
-   Tuning in multiple rounds with increasing, per-trial training step limits is
    a sensible approach.
    -   We can do as many rounds as we want, but usually 1-3 are the most
        practical.
    -   Essentially, try to obtain as much understanding of the problem as
        possible using trials with a very quick turnaround time, trading off
        tuning thoroughness with relevance to the final, longest runs.
    -   Once a given per-trial time limit has generated useful insights, we can
        increase the training time and continue tuning, double-checking our
        conclusions from the shorter runs as needed.
-   As a starting point, we recommend two rounds of tuning:
    -   Round 1: Shorter runs to find good model and optimizer hyperparameters.
    -   Round 2: Very few long runs on good hyperparameter points to get the
        final model.
-   The biggest question going from `Round i` &rarr; `Round i+1` is how to
    adjust learning rate decay schedules.
    -   One common pitfall when adjusting learning rate schedules between rounds
        is using all the extra training steps with too small of a learning rate.

#### Round 1

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>


<br>

-   Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that good hyperparameters found in
    short, incomplete training are still good choices when training length is
    significantly increased. However, for some kinds of hyperparameters, they
    are often correlated enough for Round 1 to be useful.
-   What hyperparameter values found in shorter runs do we expect to transfer to
    longer training runs? For all of this, we need more research. But based on
    what we know so far, here are the authors’ suspicions in order of decreasing
    probability of transferring:
    -   Very likely to transfer
        -   Early training instability can be resolved in the first round of
            tuning using a smaller number of training steps. Perhaps these
            hyperparameters are the closest thing to a sure bet for transfer
            that we have.
            -   Warmup length
            -   Initialization
    -   Likely to transfer
        -   Model architecture - A dramatic win in the model architecture will
            usually transfer, but there are probably many counterexamples.
    -   Might transfer
        -   Optimization algorithm/optimizer hyperparameters - We think this
            would "loosely" transfer. It’s definitely weaker than the things
            above it.
        -   Data augmentation
        -   Regularization
            -   If it isn't possible to perfectly fit the training set, the
                model might be in a regime where regularization is unlikely to
                help very much.
    -   Unlikely to transfer
        -   Learning rate schedule: unlikely to transfer perfectly.
            -   [This paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556) suggests that
                even decay schedule transfers, but we don't believe this is true
                in general. Example: Tuning sqrt decay on small # of training
                steps then extending to large # will result in the majority of
                training occurring at overly small steps.
                -   One can likely do "good enough" with most schedules in the
                    limit of extreme training budget, but noticeable performance
                    improvements can likely be seen if it is tuned.
            -   [Understanding Short-Horizon Bias in Stochastic
                Meta-Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02021) describes
                the dangers of trying to pick learning rates myopically.

</details>

#### Round 2

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>


<br>

-   Run the best hyperparameter configuration from Round 1.
-   **(Speculation)** 🤖 Use the extra steps to extend the period of training at
    a high learning rate.
    -   E.g. if linear schedule then keep the length of the decay fixed from
        Round 1 and extend the period of constant lr in the beginning.
    -   For cosine decay, just keep the base lr from Round 1 and extend
        `max_train_steps` as in
        [Chinchilla paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556).
-   More rounds might make sense for teams with very mature modeling and tuning
    pipelines and very long and expensive production training runs, but they
    will often be overkill.
    -   We've described how to transfer from Step 1 &rarr; Step 2. If we didn't care
        about analysis time and if making efficient use of compute was the
        overriding concern, then the ideal would be to exponentially increase
        the length of training runs (and thus the end-to-end time to complete a
        study) over many different rounds of tuning.
        -   At each round we systematically ensure our choices continue to hold
            up.
        -   New ideas go through a pipeline that progressively derisks them
            using increasingly long-running experiments from Step i to Step i+1.

</details>

## Additional guidance for the training pipeline

### Optimizing the input pipeline

***Summary:*** *The causes and interventions of input-bound pipelines are highly
task-dependent; use a profiler and look out for common issues.*

-   Use an appropriate profiler to diagnose input-bound pipelines. For example,
    [Perfetto](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/profiling.html) for JAX or
    [TensorFlow profiler](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/profiler) for
    TensorFlow.
-   Ultimately, the specific causes and interventions will be highly
    task-dependent. Broader engineering considerations (e.g. minimizing disk
    footprint) may warrant worse input pipeline performance.
-   Common causes:
    -   Data are not colocated with the training process, causing I/O latency
        (this might happen when reading training data over a network).
    -   Expensive online data preprocessing (consider doing this once offline
        and saving).
    -   Unintentional synchronization barriers that interfere with data pipeline
        prefetching. For example, when synchronizing metrics between the device
        and host in CommonLoopUtils
        ([link](https://github.com/google/CommonLoopUtils/blob/fea2518ada8814a78e1492023fd9f00edb0b0568/clu/metrics.py#L291)).
-   Common tips:
    -   Instrument input pipeline to prefetch examples (e.g.
        [tf.data.Dataset.prefetch](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data_performance#prefetching))
    -   Remove unused features/metadata from each as early in the pipeline as
        possible.
    -   Increase the replication of the number of jobs generating examples for
        the input pipeline. For example, by using the
        [tf.data service](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/experimental/service).

### Evaluating model performance

***Summary:*** *Run evaluation at larger batch sizes than training. Run
evaluations at regular step intervals, not regular time intervals.*

#### Evaluation settings

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>


<br>

-   There are several settings in which we can evaluate the performance of our
    models.
    -   **Online evaluation** - metrics are collected when the model is serving
        predictions in a production environment.
    -   **Offline evaluation** - metrics are collected when the model is run on
        offline train/validation/test sets that are representative of the
        production environment.
    -   **Periodic evaluations** - metrics are collected during model training
        that might either be a proxy for the offline evaluation, and/or on a
        subset of the data used in offline evaluation.
-   Online evaluation is the gold standard, but is often impractical during the
    model development phase.
-   Depending on the problem, offline evaluation can be fairly involved and
    computationally expensive.
-   Periodic evaluations are the most practical and economical choice, but may
    not fully represent the production environment.
    -   Our goal during periodic evaluation is to use an expedient proxy of the
        offline evaluation, without sacrificing the reliability of the signal we
        get during training.

</details>

#### Setting up periodic evaluations

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>


<br>

-   We run periodic evaluations during training to monitor its progress in real
    time, to
    [facilitate retrospective model checkpoint selection](#saving-checkpoints-and-retrospectively-selecting-the-best-checkpoint),
    and so that we can
    [examine the training curves at the end of training](#examining-the-training-curves).
-   The simplest configuration is to perform both training and periodic
    evaluations within the same compute instance, periodically alternating
    between training and evaluation.
    -   In this case, the batch size used to perform evaluations should be *at
        least* as large as the batch size used for training because model
        activations don't need to be maintained during evaluation, lowering the
        computational requirements per example.
-   Periodic evaluations should be done at regular step intervals, not time
    intervals.
    -   Evaluating based on time intervals can make it harder to interpret the
        training curves, especially when training may suffer from preemptions of
        the training jobs, network latency issues, etc.
-   Periodicity in valid/test metrics (when using a shuffled
    train/validation/test split) can indicate implementation bugs such as test
    data having overlap with training data, or training data not being properly
    shuffled. Evaluating at regular step intervals can make these issues easier
    to catch.
-   Partial batches can occur when the evaluation sets are not divisible by the
    batch size. Ensure that the padded examples are correctly weighed to prevent
    the loss function from being biased by them. Often, these padded examples
    can be given a weight of zero.
-   Save sufficient information per evaluation to support offline analysis.
    Ideally, we would save predictions on a selection of individual examples
    since they can be invaluable for debugging.
    -   Generating artifacts like
        [SavedModels](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model) make it easy
        to do ad-hoc model inspection after evaluation jobs finish.

</details>

#### Choosing a sample for periodic evaluation

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>


<br>

-   The periodic evaluation job might not run fast enough to compute metrics on
    the full offline evaluation set in a reasonable amount of time. This often
    necessitates sampling data for periodic evaluation.
-   We consider the following factors when constructing a sampled dataset:
    -   <ins>Sample size</ins>
        -   Check that the performance computed on the sampled dataset used by
            the periodic job matches the performance on the whole offline
            evaluation set, i.e. there is no skew between the sampled set and
            the full dataset.
        -   The dataset used for periodic evaluation should be small enough that
            it’s easy to generate model predictions over its entirety, but large
            enough that improvements to the model can be accurately measured
            (i.e. not overwhelmed by label noise).
        -   It should be large enough to accommodate multiple such evaluations
            across trials in sequence, and still produce accurate estimates.
            That is, to avoid adaptively "fitting" to the validation set over
            time, in a way that doesn't generalize to a held-out test set.
            However, this consideration is rarely a practical concern.
    -   <ins>Imbalanced datasets</ins>
        -   For imbalanced datasets, performance on rare classes of examples
            will often be noisy.
        -   For datasets with a small number of examples in a class label, log
            the number of examples predicted correctly to get more insight into
            accuracy improvements (.05 sensitivity improvement sounds exciting,
            but was it just one more example correct?).

</details>

### Saving checkpoints and retrospectively selecting the best checkpoint

***Summary:*** *Run training for a fixed number of steps and retrospectively
choose the best checkpoint from the run.*

-   Most deep learning frameworks support
    [model checkpointing](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/flax.training.html).
    That is, the current state of the model is periodically preserved on disk.
    This allows the training job to be resilient to compute instance
    interruptions.
-   The best checkpoint is often not the last checkpoint, particularly when the
    validation set performance does not continue to increase over time but
    rather fluctuates about a particular value.
-   Set up the pipeline to keep track of the N best checkpoints seen so far
    during training. At the end of training, model selection is then a matter of
    choosing the best checkpoint seen during training. We call this
    **retrospective optimal checkpoint selection**.
-   Supporting prospective early stopping is usually not necessary, since we’re
    pre-specifying a trial budget and are preserving the N best checkpoints seen
    so far.

### Setting up experiment tracking

***Summary:*** *When tracking different experiments, make sure to note a number
of essentials like the best performance of a checkpoint in the study, and a
short description of the study.*

-   We've found that keeping track of experiment results in a spreadsheet has
    been helpful for the sorts of modeling problems we've worked on. It often
    has the following columns:
    -   Study name
    -   A link to wherever the config for the study is stored.
    -   Notes or a short description of the study.
    -   Number of trials run
    -   Performance on the validation set of the best checkpoint in the study.
    -   Specific reproduction commands or notes on what unsubmitted changes were
        necessary to launch training.
-   Find a tracking system that captures at least the information listed above
    and is convenient for the people doing it. Untracked experiments might as
    well not exist.

### Batch normalization implementation details

***Summary:*** *Nowadays batch norm can often be replaced with LayerNorm, but in
cases where it cannot, there are tricky details when changing the batch size or
number of hosts.*

-   Batch norm normalizes activations using their mean and variance over the
    current batch, but in the multi-device setting these statistics are
    different on each device unless explicitly synchronized.
-   Anecdotal reports (mostly on ImageNet) say calculating these normalizing
    statistics using only ~64 examples actually works better in practice (see
    Ghost Batch Norm from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08741)).
-   Decoupling the total batch size and the number of examples used to calculate
    batch norm statistics is particularly useful for batch size comparisons.
-   Ghost batch norm implementations do not always correctly handle the case
    where the per-device batch size > virtual batch size. In this case we'd
    actually need to subsample the batch on each device in order to get the
    proper number of batch norm statistic examples.
-   Exponential moving averages used in test mode batch norm are just a linear
    combination of training statistics, so these EMAs only need to be
    synchronized before saving them in checkpoints. However, some common
    implementations of batch norm do not synchronize these EMAs and only save
    the EMA from the first device.

### Considerations for multi-host pipelines

***Summary:*** *for logging, evals, RNGs, checkpointing, and data sharding,
multi-host training can make it very easy to introduce bugs!*

-   Ensure the pipeline is only logging and checkpointing on one host.
-   Make sure before evaluation or checkpointing is run, the batch norm
    statistics are synchronized across hosts.
-   It is critical to have RNG seeds that are the same across hosts (for model
    initialization), and seeds that are different across hosts (for data
    shuffling/preprocessing), so make sure to mark them appropriately.
-   Sharding data files across hosts is usually recommended for improved
    performance.

## FAQs

### What is the best learning rate decay schedule family?

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>


<br>

-   It’s an open problem. It’s not clear how to construct a set of rigorous
    experiments to confidently answer what the "best" LR decay schedule is.
-   Although we don't know the best schedule family, we're confident that it’s
    important to have some (non-constant) schedule and that tuning it matters.
-   Different learning rates work best at different times during the
    optimization process. Having some sort of schedule makes it more likely for
    the model to hit a good learning rate.

</details>

### Which learning rate decay should I use as a default?

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>
<br>


-   Our preference is either linear decay or cosine decay, and a bunch of other
    schedule families are probably good too.

</details>

### Why do some papers have complicated learning rate schedules?

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>
<br>


-   It’s not uncommon to see papers with complicated piecewise learning rate
    (LR) decay schedules.
-   Readers often wonder how the authors arrived at such a complicated study.
-   Many complicated LR decay schedules are the result of tuning the schedule as
    a function of the validation set performance in an ad hoc way:
    1.  Start a single training run with some simple LR decay (or a constant
        learning rate).
    2.  Keep training running until the performance seems to stagnate. If this
        happens, pause training. Resume it with a perhaps steeper LR decay
        schedule (or smaller constant learning rate) from this point. Repeat
        this process until the conference/launch deadline.
-   Blithely copying the resulting *schedule* is generally not a good idea since
    the best particular schedule will be sensitive to a host of other
    hyperparameter choices.
    -   Better to copy the *algorithm* that produced the schedule, although this
        is rarely possible when arbitrary human judgment produced the schedule.
-   This type of validation-error-sensitive schedule is fine to use if it can be
    fully automated, but human-in-the-loop schedules that are a function of
    validation error are brittle and not easily reproducible, so we recommend
    avoiding them.
    -   Before publishing results that used such a schedule, please try to make
        it fully reproducible.

### How should Adam’s hyperparameters be tuned?

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>
<br>


-   As discussed above, making general statements about search spaces and how
    many points one should sample from the search space is very difficult. Note
    that not all the hyperparameters in Adam are equally important. The
    following rules of thumb correspond to different "budgets" for the number of
    trials in a study.
    -   If < 10 trials in a study, only tune the (base) learning rate.
    -   If 10-25 trials, tune learning rate and $\beta_1$.
    -   If 25+ trials, tune the learning rate, $\beta_1$ and $\epsilon$.
    -   If one can run substantially more than 25 trials, additionally tune
        $\beta_2$.

### Why use quasi-random search instead of more sophisticated black box optimization algorithms during the exploration phase of tuning?

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>


-   Quasi-random search (based on
    [low-discrepancy sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-discrepancy_sequence))
    is our preference over fancier black box optimization tools when used as
    part of an iterative tuning process intended to maximize insight into the
    tuning problem (what we refer to as the "exploration phase"). Bayesian
    optimization and similar tools are more appropriate for the exploitation
    phase.
-   Quasi-random search based on randomly shifted low-discrepancy sequences can
    be thought of as "jittered, shuffled grid search", since it uniformly, but
    randomly, explores a given search space and spreads out the search points
    more than random search.
-   The advantages of quasi-random search over more sophisticated black box
    optimization tools (e.g. Bayesian optimization, evolutionary algorithms)
    include:
    1.  Sampling the search space non-adaptively makes it possible to change the
        tuning objective in post hoc analysis without rerunning experiments.
        -   For example, we usually want to find the best trial in terms of
            validation error achieved at any point in training. But the
            non-adaptive nature of quasi-random search makes it possible to find
            the best trial based on final validation error, training error, or
            some alternative evaluation metric without rerunning any
            experiments.
    2.  Quasi-random search behaves in a consistent and statistically
        reproducible way.
        -   It should be possible to reproduce a study from six months ago even
            if the implementation of the search algorithm changes, as long as it
            maintains the same uniformity properties. If using sophisticated
            Bayesian optimization software, the implementation might change in
            an important way between versions, making it much harder to
            reproduce an old search. It isn’t always possible to roll back to an
            old implementation (e.g. if the optimization tool is run as a
            service).
    3.  Its uniform exploration of the search space makes it easier to reason
        about the results and what they might suggest about the search space.
        -   For example, if the best point in the traversal of quasi-random
            search is at the boundary of the search space, this is a good (but
            not foolproof) signal that the search space bounds should be
            changed. [This section](#identifying-bad-search-space-boundaries)
            goes into more depth. However, an adaptive black box optimization
            algorithm might have neglected the middle of the search space
            because of some unlucky early trials even if it happens to contain
            equally good points, since it is this exact sort of non-uniformity
            that a good optimization algorithm needs to employ to speed up the
            search.
    4.  Running different numbers of trials in parallel versus sequentially will
        not produce statistically different results when using quasi-random
        search (or other non-adaptive search algorithms), unlike with adaptive
        algorithms.
    5.  More sophisticated search algorithms may not always handle infeasible
        points correctly, especially if they aren't designed with neural network
        hyperparameter tuning in mind.
    6.  Quasi-random search is simple and works especially well when many tuning
        trials will be running in parallel.
        -   Anecdotally[^3], it is very hard for an adaptive algorithm to beat a
            quasi-random search that has 2X its budget, especially when many
            trials need to be run in parallel (and thus there are very few
            chances to make use of previous trial results when launching new
            trials).
        -   Without expertise in Bayesian optimization and other advanced black
            box optimization methods, we might not achieve the benefits they
            are, in principle, capable of providing. It is hard to benchmark
            advanced black box optimization algorithms in realistic deep
            learning tuning conditions. They are a very active area of current
            research, and the more sophisticated algorithms come with their own
            pitfalls for inexperienced users. Experts in these methods are able
            to get good results, but in high-parallelism conditions the search
            space and budget tend to matter a lot more.
-   That said, if our computational resources only allow a small number of
    trials to run in parallel and we can afford to run many trials in sequence,
    Bayesian optimization becomes much more attractive despite making our tuning
    results harder to interpret.

[^3]: Ben Recht and Kevin Jamieson

    [pointed out](http://www.argmin.net/2016/06/20/hypertuning/) how strong
    2X-budget random search is as a baseline (the
    [Hyperband paper](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-558/16-558.pdf)
    makes similar arguments), but it is certainly possible to find search
    spaces and problems where state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization
    techniques crush random search that has 2X the budget. However, in our
    experience beating 2X-budget random search gets much harder in the
    high-parallelism regime since Bayesian optimization has no opportunity to
    observe the results of previous trials.

### Where can I find an implementation of quasi-random search?

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>
<br>


-   We use
    [this implementation](https://github.com/mlcommons/algorithmic-efficiency/blob/main/algorithmic_efficiency/halton.py)
    that generates a Halton sequence for a given search space (intended to
    implement a shifted, scrambled Halton sequence as recommended in
    https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03200).
-   If a quasi-random search algorithm based on a low-discrepancy sequence is
    not available, it is possible to substitute pseudo random uniform search
    instead, although this is likely to be slightly less efficient.
    -   In 1-2 dimensions, grid search is also acceptable, although not in
        higher dimensions (see
        [Bergstra & Bengio, 2012](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v13/bergstra12a.html)).

### How many trials are needed to get good results with quasi-random search?

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>

<img src="assets/have_we_sampled_enough.png" width="49%" alt="A box plot showing the importance of sampling enough">
</p>


<p align="center"><b>Figure 3:</b> A ResNet-50 was tuned on ImageNet with 100
trials. Via bootstrapping, different amounts of tuning budget were simulated.
Box plots of the best performances for each trial budget are plotted above.


-   There is no way to answer this question in general, but we can look at
    specific examples.
-   As the Figure 3 shows, the number of trials in a study can have a
    substantial impact on the results.
    -   Notice how large the interquartile ranges are when 6 trials were
        sampled, versus when 20 trials were sampled.
    -   Even with 20 trials, it is likely that the difference between especially
        lucky and unlucky studies will be larger than the typical variation
        between re-trains of this model on different random seeds, with fixed
        hyperparameters, which for this workload might be around +/- 0.1% on a
        validation error rate of \~23%.

### How can optimization failures be debugged and mitigated?

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>
<br>



***Summary:*** *If the model is experiencing optimization difficulties, it’s
important to fix them before trying other things. Diagnosing and correcting
training failures is an active area of research.*

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/stride_instability.png" width="80%" alt="Changing the strides in a single residual block in a WideResnet results in training instability.">
</p>



<p align="center"><b>Figure 4:</b> Changing the strides in a single residual block (2x2 -> 1x1) in a WideResnet results in training instability. This does not degrade performance at low learning rates, but high learning rates no longer train well due to the instability. Applying 1000 steps of learning rate warmup resolves this particular instance of instability, allowing stable training at max learning rate of .1.</p>

#### Identifying unstable workloads

-   Any workload will become unstable if the learning rate is too large.
    Instability is only an issue when it forces us to use a learning rate that’s
    too small.
-   There are at least two types of training instability worth distinguishing:
    1.  Instability at initialization/early in training.
    2.  Sudden instability in the middle of training.
-   We can take a systematic approach to identifying stability issues in our
    workload.
    1.  Do a learning rate sweep and find the best learning rate lr*.
    2.  Plot training loss curves for learning rates just above lr*.
    3.  If the learning rates > lr* show loss instability (loss goes up not down
        during periods of training), then it is likely that fixing the
        instability will result in better training.
-   Log the L2 norm of the full loss gradient during training, outlier values
    can result in spurious instability in the middle of training. This can
    inform how to pick gradient/update clipping.

**NOTE:** Some models show very early instability followed by a recovery that
results in slow but stable training. **Common evaluation schedules can miss
these issues by not evaluating frequently enough!**

To check for this, we can train for an abbreviated run of just \~500 steps using
`lr = 2 * current best`, but evaluate every step.

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/more_frequent_evals.png" width="80%" alt="Illustration of the value of more frequent evaluations at the start of
training.">
</p>


<p align="center"><b>Figure 5:</b> Illustration of the value of more frequent evaluations at the start of training. Useful if there’s a suspicion that the model suffers from early training instability.</p>

#### Potential fixes for common instability patterns

-   Apply learning rate warmup
    -   Best for early training instability.
-   Apply gradient clipping
    -   Good for both early and mid training instability, may fix some bad inits
        that warmup cannot.
-   Try a new optimizer
    -   Sometimes Adam can handle instabilities that Momentum can’t. This is an
        active area of research.
-   We can ensure that we’re using best practices/initializations for our model
    architecture (examples below).
    -   Add residual connections and normalization if the model doesn't contain
        it already.
-   Normalization should be the last operation before the residual. E.g. x +
    Norm(f(x)).
-   Norm(x + f(x)) known to cause issues.
-   Try initializing residual branches to 0 (e.g.
    [ReZero init](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04887)).
-   Lower the learning rate
    -   This is a last resort.

#### Learning rate warmup

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/instability_during_warmup.png" width="80%" alt="An example of instability during a warmup period (note the horizontal axis log
scale).">
</p>


<p align="center"><b>Figure 6:</b> An example of instability during a warmup period (note the horizontal axis log scale). 40k steps of warmup was needed for successful training in this case.</p>

##### When to apply learning rate warmup

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/axis_model_with_instability.png" width="49%" alt="Axis plot for model with instability">
</p>


<p align="center"><b>Figure 7a:</b> An example of a hyperparameter axis plot for a model exhibiting training instability. The best learning rate is at the edge of what is feasible. An "infeasible" trial is defined as one that either produces NaNs or uncharacteristically high values of the loss.</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/loss_model_with_instability.png" width="49%" alt="Loss curve for model with instability">
</p>


<p align="center"><b>Figure 7b:</b> The training loss of a model trained with a learning rate where we see instability.</p>

-   Figure 7a shows a hyperparameter axis plot that indicates a model
    experiencing optimization instabilities, because the best learning rate is
    right at the edge of instability.
-   Figure 7b shows how this can be double-checked by examining the training
    loss of a model trained with a learning rate either 5x or 10x larger than
    this peak. If that plot shows a sudden rise in the loss after a steady
    decline (e.g. at step \~10k in the figure above), then the model likely
    suffers from optimization instability.

##### How to apply learning rate warmup

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/beneficial_effect_warmup.png" width="80%" alt="Beneficial effect of warmup on training instabilities">
</p>


<p align="center"><b>Figure 8:</b> Beneficial effect of learning rate warmup on addressing training instabilities.</p>

-   Using the section immediately above, we assume that the practitioner has
    already identified the learning rate at which the model becomes unstable.
    This is the `unstable_base_learning_rate`.
-   Warmup involves prepending a learning rate schedule that ramps up the
    learning rate from 0 to some stable `base_learning_rate`, that is at least
    one order of magnitude larger than `unstable_base_learning_rate`. The
    default would be to try a `base_learning_rate` that’s 10x
    `unstable_base_learning_rate`. Although note that it’d be possible to run
    this entire procedure again for something like 100x
    `unstable_base_learning_rate`. The specific schedule is:
    -   Ramp up from 0 to `base_learning_rate` over `warmup_steps`.
    -   Train at a constant rate for `post_warmup_steps`.
-   Our goal is to find the shortest number of `warmup_steps` that allows us to
    access peak learning rates that are much higher than
    `unstable_base_learning_rate`.
-   So for each `base_learning_rate`, we need to tune `warmup_steps` and
    `post_warmup_steps`. It’s usually fine to set `post_warmup_steps` to be
    `2*warmup_steps`.
-   Warmup can be tuned independently of an existing decay schedule.
    `warmup_steps` should be swept at a few different orders of magnitude. For
    example, an example study could try [10, 10<sup>3</sup>, 10<sup>4</sup>,
    10<sup>5</sup>]. The largest feasible point shouldn't be more than 10% of
    `max_train_steps`.
-   Once a `warmup_steps` that doesn't blow up training at `base_learning_rate`
    has been established, it should be applied to the baseline model.
    Essentially, we prepend this schedule onto the existing schedule, and use
    the optimal checkpoint selection discussed above to compare this experiment
    to the baseline. For example, if we originally had 10,000 `max_train_steps`
    and did `warmup_steps` for 1000 steps, the new training procedure should run
    for 11,000 steps total.
-   If long `warmup_steps` are required for stable training (>5% of
    `max_train_steps`), `max_train_steps` may need to be increased to account
    for this.
-   There isn't really a "typical" value across the full range of workloads.
    Some models only need 100 steps, while others (particularly transformers)
    may need 40k+.

#### Gradient clipping

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/gradient_clipping.png" width="80%" alt="Gradient clipping on early training instabilities">
</p>


<p align="center"><b>Figure 9:</b> Illustration of gradient clipping correcting early training instability.</p>

-   Gradient clipping is most useful when large or outlier gradient issues
    occur.
-   Clipping can fix either early training instability (large gradient norm
    early), or mid training instabilities (sudden gradient spikes mid training).
-   Sometimes longer warmup periods can correct instabilities that clipping does
    not: see [this section above](#How-to-apply-learning-rate-warmup).
    -   🤖 What about clipping during warmup?
-   The ideal clip thresholds are just above the "typical" gradient norm.
-   Here’s an example of how gradient clipping could be done:
    -   If the norm of the gradient $\left | g \right |$ is greater than the
        gradient clipping threshold $\lambda$, then do ${g}'= \lambda \times \frac{g}{\left | g \right |}$ where ${g}'$ is the new gradient.
-   Log the unclipped gradient norm during training. By default, generate:
    -   A plot of gradient norm vs step
    -   A histogram of gradient norms aggregated over all steps
-   Choose a gradient clipping threshold based on the 90th percentile of
    gradient norms.
    -   The threshold will be workload dependent, but 90% is a good starting
        point. If it doesn't work, this threshold can be tuned.
    -   🤖 What about some sort of adaptive strategy?
-   If we try gradient clipping and the instability issues remain, we can try it
    harder (i.e. make the threshold smaller).
-   Extremely aggressive gradient clipping is in essence a strange way of
    reducing the learning rate. If we find ourselves using extremely aggressive
    clipping, we probably should just cut the learning rate instead.
-   We would usually consider having >50% of the updates getting clipped somehow
    as "extremely aggressive".
-   If we need to do extremely aggressive gradient clipping to deal with our
    instability issues, then we might as well reduce the learning rate.

</details>

### Why do you call the learning rate and other optimization parameters hyperparameters? They are not parameters of any prior distribution.

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>
<br>


-   It is true that the term "hyperparameter" has a precise
    [meaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter) in Bayesian machine
    learning and referring to the learning rate and most of the other parameters
    we tune in deep learning as "hyperparameters" is an abuse of terminology.
-   We would prefer to use the term "metaparameter" for learning rates,
    architectural parameters, and all the other things we tune in deep learning,
    since it avoids the potential for confusion that comes from misusing the
    word "hyperparameter" (confusion that is especially likely when discussing
    Bayesian optimization where the probabilistic response surface models have
    their own true hyperparameters).
-   Unfortunately, although potentially confusing, the term hyperparameter has become
    extremely common in the deep learning community.
-   Therefore, for a document, such as this one, intended for a wide audience
    that includes many people who are unlikely to be aware of this technicality,
    we made the choice to contribute to one source of confusion in the
    field in hopes of avoiding another.
-   That said, we might make a different choice when publishing a research
    paper, and we would encourage others to use "metaparameter" instead in most
    contexts.

### Why shouldn't the batch size be tuned to directly improve validation set performance?

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>
<br>


-   Changing the batch size *without changing any other details of the training pipeline* will often affect the validation set performance.
-   However, the difference in validation set performance between two batch sizes typically goes away if the training pipeline is optimized independently for each batch size.
-   The hyperparameters that interact most strongly with the batch size, and therefore are most important to tune separately for each batch size, are the optimizer hyperparameters (e.g. learning rate, momentum) and the regularization hyperparameters.
    - Smaller batch sizes introduce more noise into the training algorithm due to sample variance, and this noise can have a regularizing effect. Thus, larger batch sizes can be more prone to overfitting and may require stronger regularization and/or additional regularization techniques.
-   In addition, [the number of training steps may need to be adjusted](#choosing-the-batch-size-to-minimize-training-time) when changing the batch size.
-   Once all these effects are taken into account, there is currently no convincing evidence that the batch size affects the maximum achievable validation performance (see [Shallue et al. 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03600)).
